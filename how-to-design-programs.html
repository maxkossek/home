<h2 id="prologue-how-to-program">Prologue: How to Program</h2>
<p>A <em>1String</em> is a string with length one (char).</p>
<h2 id="i-fixed-size-data">I Fixed-Size Data</h2>
<h3 id="1-arithmetic">1 Arithmetic</h3>
<p>Operations on numbers: +, -, *, /, abs, add1, ceiling, sqr etc. BSL distinguishes exact numbers and inexact numbers. A predicate is a function that determines whether an input belongs to some class of data <code>number? 4</code> evaluates to true.</p>
<h3 id="2-functions-and-programs">2 Functions and Programs</h3>
<p>Programs are functions, they consume inputs and produce outputs. Two kinds of definitions: 1. constant definitions <code>(define x 5)</code>; 2. function definitions that use parameters <code>(define (Function_Name Variable ... Variable) Expression)</code>. Best practice is to define one function per task. <em>Batch</em> programs consume all inputs at once and computes the result. <em>Interactive</em> program consumes some of its inputs, computes, produces some output, consumes more input, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="3-how-to-design-programs">3 How to Design Programs</h3>
<p>Programs consume information (domain), then execute functions and produce output (range). Data definitions are often written in the form of comments <code>; A Temperature is a number</code>. The design process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Express how you wish to represent information as data <code>; We use numbers to represent centimeters</code></li>
<li>What does the function compute? Write down a signature, a statement of purpose, and a function header <code>; String -&gt; Number</code></li>
<li>Illustrate signature and purpose statement with functional examples</li>
<li>Take inventory, to understand what are the givens and what we need to compute</li>
<li>Write executable expressions and function definitions</li>
<li>Test the function on examples</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-intervals-enumerations-and-itemizations">4 Intervals, Enumerations, and Itemizations</h3>
<p>Intervals are collections of elements that satisfy a specific property. <em>Enumerations</em> list every single piece of data that belong to it. <em>Itemizations</em>, mixes the first two, specifying ranges in one clause of its definition and specific pieces of data in another. <em>Finite state machines</em> (FSM), are state transition diagrams with limited number of states.</p>
<h3 id="5-adding-structure">5 Adding Structure</h3>
<p>Structure type definition is another form of definition. It creates many different functions in one line <code>(define-struct StructureName [FieldNames])</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(<span class="hljs-name">define-struct</span> movie [title producer year])
(<span class="hljs-name">make-movie</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Title"</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Producer"</span> <span class="hljs-number">2000</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment">; movie-title can be used as selector</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">; movie? is predicate</span>
</code></pre><p>Sets are data collections or data classes. Data definitions play a central and important role in the design process. They delimit the possible ranges of values for functions / variable.</p>
<h3 id="6-itemizations-and-structures">6 Itemizations and Structures</h3>
<p>Data definitions describes a structure, the appropriate input data types, and what the inputs represent. Add predicates to program to throw error messages early, if a faulty data type is passed.</p>
<h3 id="7-summary">7 Summary</h3>
<p>Good programmers design, bad programmers tinker.</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo-1">Intermezzo 1</h2>
<p>Syntax is grammar, semantics is meaning. A sentence can be grammatically correct but make no sense.</p>
<pre><code>; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span> application:

; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span> definition:
(define (<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span>-<span class="hljs-keyword">name</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">parameter</span> ... <span class="hljs-keyword">parameter</span>)
      <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span>-body)

      cond-clause)
; structure <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> definition
(define-struct <span class="hljs-keyword">name</span> [<span class="hljs-keyword">name</span>])
</code></pre><h2 id="ii-arbitrarily-large-data">II Arbitrarily Large Data</h2>
<h3 id="8-lists">8 Lists</h3>
<p>An empty list is written <code>&#39;()</code>, a one item list <code>(cons &quot;Hello&quot; &#39;())</code>, two item list <code>(cons &quot;Hello&quot; (cons &quot;World&quot; &#39;()))</code>. Predicates: <code>empty?</code> to check if list empty; <code>cons?</code> to check if cons. Selectors: <code>first</code> selects the first item of a cons; <code>rest</code> selects the rest of a cons.</p>
<h3 id="9-designing-with-self-referential-data-definitions">9 Designing with Self-Referential Data Definitions</h3>
<p>Self-use of a function is called <em>recursion</em>. Design process for recursion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Problem Analysis: Develop a data representation for the information</li>
<li>Header: Write down a signature using defined names</li>
<li>Examples: Work through examples</li>
<li>Template: Translate the data definition into a template</li>
<li>Definition: Find a function that combines the values of the expressions in the cond clauses into the expected answer</li>
<li>Tests: Write check-expect testing suite.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="more-on-lists">More on Lists</h3>
<p>Lists and sets both are collections of values, but they differ:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<h3 id="11-design-by-composition">11 Design by Composition</h3>
<p><code>list</code> is shorthand for cons <code>(list &quot;Hello&quot; &quot;World&quot; &quot;.&quot;)</code>. Keep a wishlist of functions that must be designed to complete a program.</p>
<h3 id="12-projects-lists">12 Projects: Lists</h3>
<p>Recursive functions deal with self-references. Auxiliary functions deal with cross-references. Complex problems need to be decomposed into smaller ones.</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo-2-quote-unquote">Intermezzo 2: Quote, Unquote</h2>
<p>Quote is another shorthand for lists <code>&#39;(&quot;Hello&quot; &quot;World&quot; &quot;.&quot;)</code>. Use quasiquote to evaluate an expression during construction of a list.</p>
<pre><code>(define x <span class="hljs-number">42</span>)
`(<span class="hljs-number">40</span> <span class="hljs-number">41</span> ,x <span class="hljs-number">43</span>)
; returns (<span class="hljs-type">list</span> <span class="hljs-number">40</span> <span class="hljs-number">41</span> <span class="hljs-number">42</span> <span class="hljs-number">43</span>)
</code></pre><p>Use <code>,@</code> to unquote-splice a nested list from it&#39;s surrounding list.</p>
<h2 id="iii-abstraction">III Abstraction</h2>
<p>Copying mistakes comes with copying code. One fix may have to be applied to many copies. This process is expensive and error-prone.</p>
<h3 id="14-similarities-everywhere">14 Similarities Everywhere</h3>
<p>Thou shall not steal code, not even your own. Instead, you must abstract over similar pieces of code. A <em>Parametric data definition</em> abstracts from a reference to a particular collection of data in the same manner as a function abstracts from a particular value <code>; A [list-of-item] is one of: &#39;(), (cons item [list-of-item])</code>. </p>
<h3 id="15-designing-abstractions">15 Designing Abstractions</h3>
<p>To abstract is to turn something concrete into a parameter. Putting the definition for some functionality in one place makes it easy to maintain a program. When you discover a mistake, you have to go to just one place to fix it. Form an abstraction instead of copying and modifying any code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare two items for similarities.</li>
<li>Abstract - replace the contents of corresponding code highlights with new names and add these names to the parameter list.</li>
<li>Validate - test by defining the two original functions in terms of the abstraction.</li>
<li>Write new signature: <code>; [X Y] [List-of X] [X -&gt; Y] -&gt; [List-of Y]</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="16-using-abstractions">16 Using Abstractions</h3>
<p><em>Local definitions</em>, or private definitions are used for functions that play a subordinate role and have no use outside of a narrow context. Use local to reformulate deeply nested expressions. Use well-chosen names to express what the expressions compute.</p>
<pre><code>(<span class="hljs-name">local</span> (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">def</span></span> ...)
  ; — IN —
  body-expression)
</code></pre><p>Design Recipe for Abstraction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow design recipe for functions (Distill the problem statement into a signature, a purpose statement, an example, and a stub definition.)</li>
<li>Find a matching abstraction. To match means to pick an abstraction whose purpose is more general than the one for the function to be designed; it also means that the signatures are related.</li>
<li>Write down a template. For the reuse of abstractions, a template uses local for two different purposes.</li>
<li>Define the auxiliary function inside local.</li>
<li>Test the definition.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="17-nameless-functions">17 Nameless Functions</h3>
<p>We can view lambda as an abbreviation for a local expression <code>(lambda (variable1 variable2 ...) expression)</code>. A function definition abbreviates a plain constant definition with a lambda expression on the right-hand side.</p>
<pre><code>(<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">define</span></span> (<span class="hljs-name">f</span> x)
    (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">*</span></span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span> x))

<span class="hljs-comment">; lambda version</span>
(<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">define</span></span> f
    (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">lambda</span></span> (x) (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">*</span></span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span> x)))
</code></pre><p>Lambda makes short functions much more readable than local definitions.</p>
<h3 id="18-summary">18 Summary</h3>
<p>Repeated code patterns call for abstraction. Most languages come with a large collection of abstractions.</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo-3-scope-and-abstraction">Intermezzo 3: Scope and Abstraction</h2>
<p>Two kinds of variable occurrences: variable in the function header is a <em>binding occurrence</em> and those in the function's body are the <em>bound occurrences</em>. Regions where binding occurence works is called the lexical scope. Free occurrence applies to a variable without any binding occurrence (not defined). The scope of local definitions is the local expression.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">; f and g are called top-level scopes</span>
(<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">define</span></span> (<span class="hljs-name">f</span> x) 
    (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">+</span></span> (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">*</span></span> x x) <span class="hljs-number">25</span>))
(<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">define</span></span> (<span class="hljs-name">g</span> x) 
    (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">+</span></span> (<span class="hljs-name">f</span> (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">+</span></span> x <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)) 
    (<span class="hljs-name">f</span> (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-builtin-name">-</span></span> x <span class="hljs-number">1</span>))))
</code></pre><p>A loop traverses compound data, processing one piece at a time. Each evaluation of a loop body is called an iteration.</p>
<h2 id="iv-intertwined-data">IV Intertwined Data</h2>
<h3 id="19-the-poetry-of-s-expressions">19 The Poetry of S-Expressions</h3>
<p>Design recipe for self-referential data definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw arrows to connect references to definitions. Construct some examples for every individual definition. </li>
<li>Design as many functions in parallel as there are data definitions.</li>
<li>Work through functional examples that use all mutual references in the nest of data definitions.</li>
<li>For each function, design the template according to its primary data definition.</li>
<li>For the design of the body, start with cond lines that do not contain natural recursions or calls to other functions. They are called base cases. The corresponding answers are typically easy to formulate. After that, deal with the self-referential cases and the cases of cross-function calls.</li>
<li>Run the tests when all definitions are completed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="20-iterative-refinement">20 Iterative Refinement</h3>
<p>Iterative refinement is a well-known scientific process. If the discrepancies between the predictions and the measurements are too large, a model is refined with the goal of improving the predictions. This iterative process continues until the predictions are sufficiently accurate.</p>
<h3 id="21-refining-interpreters">21 Refining Interpreters</h3>
<p>Many people refer to the interactions area as the read-eval-print loop, where eval is short for evaluator, a function that is also called interpreter. Programmers invented parsers to bridge the gap between convenience of use and implementation. A parser simultaneously checks whether some piece of data conforms to a data definition and, if it does, builds a matching element from the chosen class of data.</p>
<h3 id="22-project-the-commerce-of-xml">22 Project: The Commerce of XML</h3>
<p><em>Configuration</em> refers to the data that the main function needs when the program is launched.</p>
<h3 id="23-simultaneous-processing">23 Simultaneous Processing</h3>
<p>If one of the parameters plays a dominant role, think of others as atomic, and design around dominant parameters. If multiple parameters are of the same length, process them simultaneously by applying recursion to all parameters at the same time. If no obvious connection between the parameters, then must go through all possible examples (Create table of possible combinations).</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo-4-the-nature-of-numbers">Intermezzo 4: The Nature of Numbers</h2>
<p>Overflow occurs when Inex arithmetic produces numbers that are too large to be represented. Arithmetic operations preserve exactness when possible; they produce an inexact result when necessary. How to deal with the exactness of numbers depends on the field (finance vs. science).</p>
<h2 id="v-generative-recursion">V Generative Recursion</h2>
<p>Programmers also use generative recursion, a form of recursion that is strictly more powerful than structural recursion. An algorithm tends to rearrange a problem into a set of several problems, solve those, and combine their solutions into one overall solution. Often some of these newly generated problems are the same kind of problem as the given one, in which case the algorithm can be reused to solve them. In these cases, the algorithm is recursive, but it&#39;s recursion uses newly generated data not immediate parts of the input data.</p>
<h3 id="25-non-standard-recursion">25 Non-standard Recursion</h3>
<p>There is no clear standard or way to find algorithms. In many fields there is plenty of room for exploration.</p>
<h3 id="26-designing-algorithms">26 Designing Algorithms</h3>
<p>Design Recipe for Geneative Recursion:</p>
<ol>
<li>analyze the problem information and define data collections.</li>
<li>signature, a function header, and a purpose statement.</li>
<li>explain the "how" with function examples.</li>
<li>define the algorithm as functions and expressions in terms of the chosen data representation.</li>
<li>test it.</li>
<li>termination, with (1) a size argument for each recursive call or (2) examples of exceptions to termination.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a function keeps repeating itself, computer scientists say it does not terminate. Generative recursion may generate new problems without any limitations. Structural recursion relies on systematic data analysis and not much more; generative recursion often requires a deep, often mathematical, insight into the problem-solving process itself. Observable equivalence is when two functions produce the same output given the same input, but still might use different processes to process the input. Experience shows that most functions in a program employ structural design; only a few exploit generative recursion.</p>
<h3 id="28-mathematical-examples">28 Mathematical Examples</h3>
<p>Many solutions to mathematical problems employ generative recursion. Adaptive algorithms allocate time to those parts of the graph that need it and spend little time on the others.</p>
<h3 id="30-summary">30 Summary</h3>
<p>Unlike structurally designed functions, algorithms may not terminate for some inputs. This problem might be due to inherent limitations in the idea or the translation of the idea into code.</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo-5-the-cost-of-computation">Intermezzo 5: The Cost of Computation</h2>
<p>Evaluating (how-many some-list) takes roughly n times some fixed amount times where n is the length of the list. An average analysis starts from the ideas that programmers cannot assume that inputs are always of the best possible shape and that they must hope that the inputs are not of the worst possible shape. A best-case analysis focuses on the class of inputs for which the program can easily find the answer. A worst-case analysis determines how badly a program performs for those inputs that stress it most. Given a function g on the natural numbers, O(g) (pronounced: "big-O of g") is a class of functions on natural numbers. A function f is a member of O(g) if there exist numbers c and bigEnough such that for all n &gt;= bigEnough it is true that f(n) &lt;= c*g(n).</p>
<h2 id="vi-accumulators">VI Accumulators</h2>
<p>Accumulator: an argument that represents the context of the function call. During the recursive calls, the accumulator changes in relation to the context.</p>
<h3 id="32-designing-accumulator-style-functions">32 Designing Accumulator-Style Functions</h3>
<p>Design recipe for functions that use accumulator parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sketch a manual evaluation of an application of function to understand the nature of the accumulator.</li>
<li>Determine the kind of data that the accumulator tracks. Accumulator definition is also called invariant because the relationship between the argument, and the original argument stays constant over time. </li>
<li>Use the invariant (constant relation) to determine the initial value a0 for a.</li>
<li>Exploit the invariant to determine how to compute the accumulator for the recursive function calls within the definition of function/a.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="34-summary">34 Summary</h3>
<p>Traversals "forget" pieces of the argument when they progress throughout the program. Check if the knowledge of this lost data helps, and then introduce an accumulator. Describe an accumulator statement that describes what the accumulator knows and what data it stores. Determine the accumulator initial state, how it needs to be updates, and how to use it"s knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue-moving-on">Epilogue: Moving On</h2>
<p>Computing generalizes simple arithmetic (0's and 1's) to more general processes, so we can compute almost any type of data in a variety of ways.</p>
