# cat: writing or concatenation
cat			# Create, append, display and concatenate file
cat > FILE 		# Write file
cat >> FILE		# Append to a file
cat FILE		# Display file
cat FILE | nl  		# Sends output of file to number line

# cut: trim out parts of a file

# diff: comparing files
# -w = ignore whitespace
# -i = ignore upper/lower case

# find: search for file names and properties
# -name = name search
# -size = size search
# -print = print found files
find . -name '*.txt' -print	# Print text files in current directory
find ./DIR -size +1k -print	# Print all files in DIR with size > 1KiB

# grep: pattern search
# -c = print count
# -i = case-insensitive
# -v = invert search (not containing pattern)

# nl & wc: for counting lines and words
nl FILE			# Display lines with a line count
wc FILE			# Count lines, words and characters

# paste: align files side-by-side
# -s = rows instead of columns
# -d = delimiter is a comma
paste one.txt two.txt	# Display lines side-by-side

# sort: sort lines
# -u = only sort unique rows
# -ru = sort in reverse order
# -k2 = sort by specific column (e.g. 2)
# -f = ignore case
# -n = sort numerically
# -t"," = change delimiter (e.g. comma)
sort data.txt		# Sort alphabetically

# tr: text manipulation
echo 'Hello World!' | tr -d l		# Delete character
> 'Heo World!'
echo 'Hello World!' | tr -s l ' '	# Replace character
> 'He o Wor d!'

# uniq: unique parts of a file
# -d = duplicate lines
# -c = number of occurrences
cat data.txt | uniq	# Only display unique lines
