<a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vim</a> or Vi is a text editor installed by default on most operating systems. The commands below are used in command mode, the default mode in Vim. Most traditional text editors don't distinguish between command and insertion modes. 

One of the main advantages of having a command mode is that navigation and modification of elements is faster. This is especially useful for programmers, because they spend a large amount of their time reading rather than writing (debugging and modifying common patterns). Vim has a learning curve, but becomes useful very quickly once you know the basic commands.

```
