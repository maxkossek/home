<a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vim</a> or Vi is a text editor installed by default on most operating systems. The commands below are used in command mode, the default mode in Vim. Most traditional text editors always place the user into insert mode. One of the main advantages of having a command mode is that navigation and insertion / deletion of elements is faster. This is why Vim is mainly used by programmers, because their ratio of writing:reading is lower. Debugging and modifying programs becomes a lot easier with command mode. Vim has a steep learning curve, but is very rewarding once mastered.

### Opening a file
Vim can open most editable file types. To open a .txt file, type `$ vim filename.txt` in the command line / terminal. To create a new file, type the filename and file type; `$ vim filename.c` creates a C file.

### Navigation Commands
`h` = left one character     
`l` = right one character   
`j` = down one line   
`k` = up one line    
`{` & `}` = back & forward a paragraph    
`H` = move cursor to first line of page    
`L` = move cursor to last line of page    
`gg` = move cursor to first line of file    
`G` = move cursor to last line of file    
`CTRL + b` = page back    
`CTRL + f` = page forward    
`%` = move to matching parenthesis/bracket   

### Modes
`i` = insert mode   
`ESC` = exit insert mode, go to command mode    
`v` = visual mode   

### Writing
`a` = insert after current character   
`A` = insert at end of current line   

### Copy / Paste
`Y` = copy current line   
`yy` = copy current visually selected lines   
`p` = paste underneath current line   
`P` = paste above current line   

### Deletion
`D` = delete until end of line   
`dd` = delete & copy line   
`cw` = delete from cursor to end of word   
`daw` = delete word under the cursor    
`x` = delete current character   
`r` = replace current character    

### Undo / Redo
`u` = undo
`CTRL + r` = redo

### Saving / Exiting
`:w` = save file   
`:wq` = save file and close   

### Search
Vim search is case sensitive. To remove case sensitivity from a search, type `\c`.

`/term` = search file for "term"   
`n` = next occurence of searchterm
`N` = previous occurence of searchterm
`:%s/old/new/g` = replace all occurences of "old" with "new"
