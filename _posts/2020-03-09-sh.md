NAME
----

sh - POSIX-compliant command interpreter.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

POSIX shell scripts commonly end with either the ".sh" or no file extension. Adding the shebang line "#!/bin/sh" at the top of a file signals the shell to invoke the program using the system shell. Scripts can be run by invoking `sh` or by executing an executable script directly. The `-x` option enables debug mode.
```
$ sh [shell_script_name]
```

Calling the `exit` builtin terminates a shell script. If `exit` isn't called explicitly, then the shell returns after all the commands have been executed. The `exit` command takes an optional non-negative integer argument which sets the return value of the process. This return value is stored in the `$?` variable, which stores the return value of the last terminated process.

The dash shell tries to closely follow POSIX standards. The `shellcheck(1)` static analysis tool checks your script for POSIX compliance as well as other common script errors.


PARAMETERS
----------

$0 - Parameter 0 (process name).

$1, $2 ... $9 - Parameters 1 through 9.

$# - Argument count.

$? - Return value / error status of the previous process.

$- - Option flags.

$$ - Process number.

$! - Process number of the last background command.

$ - All argument values.

$@ - All argument values, preserving spaces inside arguments.


SIGNAL VALUES
-------------

0 - Success.

1 - SIGHUP: Hangup.

2 - SIGINT: Keyboard intterupt (Ctrl+c).

3 - SIGQUIT: Keyboard quit (Ctrl-\).

4 - SIGILL: Terminate process and dump core.

6 - SIGABRT: Abort signal from the software.

8 - SIGFPE: Floating point exception.

9 - SIGKILL: Kill signal.

15 - SIGTERM: Termination signal.

20 - SIGSTP: Stop signal (Ctrl+z).


INPUT / OUTPUT
--------------

The `echo` command writes its argument to the standard output. The `printf` builtin prints its arguments, and provides additional formatting controls.
```
echo "Hello World"
echo "Path: $PATH"

printf "Hello World"
printf "Number = %d" "$num"
printf "$d" "$(( x + 5 ))"
```

The `read` builtin reads a user's input from STDIN. Enabling the `-r` option makes the shell strip the leading and trailing spaces from the input. The `IFS` variable, which defaults to a space (" "), defines the field separator used for the input.
```
printf "Name: "
read -r first_name last_name

IFS="-"
printf "Enter: YYYY-MM-DD "
read -r year month day

while read a; do
	echo $a
done
```

The standard file descriptors are STDIN (0), STDOUT (1), and STDERR (2). The ">" and "<" operators redirect the input and output from these files. "<" changes the file descriptor of STDIN. ">" redirects STDOUT to a different file descriptor. ">>" appends a commands output to a file. 2>&1 redirects STDERR to STDOUT. Redirecting output to /dev/null discards it.
```
cat >> file.txt
printf "Redirect stderr to stdout\n" 2>&1
ls >/dev/null
```

The `exec` builtin can redirect the input and output of a shell script.
```
exec > "$file"
```


OPERATORS
---------

Arithmetic operators: +, -, /, *, %, +=. The `$(( ))` syntax performs arithmetic expansion on the operation.
```
x=$(( x + y ))
x=$(( x * 2 % y ))
$(( x += 1 ))
x=$(( x - 1 ))
```

Bitwise operators: ~, <<, >>, &, ^, |.
```
x=$(( ~x ))
x=$(( x << 2 ))
x=$(( x & y ))
```

Boolean operators: &&, ||, !.
```
[ "$a" = "a" ] && [ "$b" = "b" ]
[ "$a" != "x" ] || [ "$b" -ge 0 ]
[ ! "$x" -eq 1 ]
ls && echo "Hello"
cat file.txt || echo "Error: Unable to open file"
```

Integer comparison: -eq, -ne, -gt, -ge, -lt, -le. Integer comparisons must be enclosed inside brackets ("[]").
```
if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]
if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]
```

String comparison: =, !=, test -z (empty string).
```
if [ "$a" = "$b" ]
if [ "$a" != "$b" ]
test -z "$a"
```


STRINGS
-------

Two strings can be concatenated using string expansion. Single quotes (') preserve the literal meaning of all characters, while double quotes (") preserve the meaning of all characters except "$", "*", and "\".
```
a="Hello"
b="World"
c="$a $b"

$ echo '$HOME'
$HOME
$ echo "$HOME"
/home/user
```


VARIABLES
---------

Variable names can consist of letters and underscore characters. The data type fo a variable is usually inferred.
```
x=1
s="Hello World"
pi=3.1415926
USER=$( whoami )
```

The `readonly` keyword declares a variable as a constant. Changing a constants value signals a readonly error. The `unset` keyword deletes a variable or function during program execution.
```
readonly x=5

y=5
echo $y
unset y
echo $y
```


ERROR HANDLING
--------------

The `${}` operator handles undefined variables. Prefixing `${}` with a colon (":") makes the operator handle undefined variables as well as null variables (e.g. ${parameter:?[word]}).

${parameter?[word]} - Output an optional error message word if the parameter is undefined.

${parameter-word} - Set the variable to a default value if it is undefined.

${parameter=word} - Redefine the variable if it is undefined.

${parameter+word} - Change a variables value if it is defined.

```
printf "%s %s %s\n" "${x=5}" "${y-"Default Y"}" "${x+10}"
y=
printf "%s\n" "${y:-"Y is null"}"
unset x
printf "%s\n" "${x?"Undefined value for x"}"
```


EXPR
----

The `expr` utility evaluates shell expressions. It supports the standard arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, % as well as the logical operators =, !=, >, >=, <, <=, |, &. It can also match strings to a regular expression. When used on regular expressions, `expr` returns the number of matching characters, or 0 if the the string doesn't match the pattern.
```
expr $x + 2
expr $x "*" 2 - 3
expr $x ">" 0 "&" $y "=" "hello"
expr "hello world" : "hello world"
```


FUNCTIONS
---------

Function declarations require no keyword. Function parameters are stored inside the variables $1, $2, and so on. A function's return value is either the exit status of the last command, or the value specified in the `return` statement.
```
add() {
	printf "%d\n" "$(( $1 + $2 ))"
	return 0
}

add 2 3
```


CONDITIONALS
------------

If-else statements have multiple optional elif statements and a single optional else statement. All condition statements must begin with the "then" keyword and end with the "fi" keyword.
```
if [ "$x" = 'x' ]; then
	echo "Unknown"
if [ "$x" -lt "$num" ]; then
	echo "Smaller"
elif [ "$x" -gt "$num" ]; then
	echo "Bigger"
else
	echo "Equal"
fi
```

The test utility tests if a condition is true, and can be used in combination with the "&&" (and) or "||" (or) symbols to control program execution. "&&" executes the next command if the first command evaluated to true (0 exit status). The "||" operator executes the next command if the first command was false (non-zero exit status).
```
true && echo "print"
false || echo "print"
```

A `case` statement evaluates a variable against some number of consecutive patterns. The case statement then evaluates the set of commands if the pattern matches. All `case` statements must end with the "esac" keyword.
```
case $var in
	pattern1 )
	command1
	commandN
	;;
	pattern2 | pattern3 )
	command1;;
	* )
	default_command;;
esac

case $x in
	[0-9] ) printf "Number\n";;
	[a-z] ) printf "Lowercase letter\n";;
	[A-Z] ) printf "Uppercase letter\n";;
	[A-Z]* ) printf "Capitalized word\n";;
	"test" ) printf "Test case\n";;
	* ) printf "Undefined category\n";;
esac
```


LOOPS
-----

A `for` loop evaluates a statement for some number of items. The for loop iterator can be created in a number of ways.
```
for var in item1 ... itemN
do
	Body
done

for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ...
for i in $( ls ); do ...
for i in $var; do ...
for arg in $*; do ...

for i in *.t; do
	perl $i
done
```

A `while` loop continues executing its statements until a condition is no longer met. Writing `while :` or `while true` creates an infinite loop. A `break` statement is required to exit an infinite loop. The `continue` statement makes the program to the next loop iteration.
```
while [ condition ]
do
	Body
done

while [ "$x" != "exit" ]; do ...
while [ "$x" -gt 0 ]; do ...
```

An `until` loops is the inverse of a `while` loop. It continues executing until the condition is met.
```
until [ condition ]
do
	Body
done

until [ "$x" -lt 5 ]; do ...
```


LINKING COMMANDS
----------------

cmd1 ; cmd2 - Execute commands in sequence.

cmd1 & - Execute a command in the background.

cmd1 && cmd2 - Execute cmd2 if cmd1 returns zero (succeeds).

cmd1 || cmd2 - Execute cmd2 if cmd1 returns a non-zero value (fails).

cmd1 | cmd2 - Pipe the input from cmd1 to cmd2.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

The `export` builtin exports local variables to a global resolution. The "*" character is the wildcard operator used to select all matching patterns. The use of $HOME rather than "~" is recommended for POSIX systems.
```
export PATH="$PATH:/DIR"
export HOME="$HOME/DIR"

$ ls *.c
```


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------

Paths to binaries or other scripts should always be absolute or relative in order prevent $PATH environment variable modification attacks. Never run eval on user-passed data.
